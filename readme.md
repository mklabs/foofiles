yeoman-components
=================

Yeoman / Grunt (0.4) plugin integration for
[components](https://github.com/component/component).

It'll replace the interface used in Yeoman to proxy over package-manager like
commands over bower to use components instead.

For a good introduction to components, be sure to check out [App integration
introduction screencast](https://github.com/component/component)

**TODO**

```sh
# in a yeoman app, after yeoman init
npm install <this-plugin>
yeoman init component
```

`yeoman init component` will scaffold out the necessary infrastructure for you
to start using components and components-build.

Done.
