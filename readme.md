Personal playground for growing packages.

This include some tests and experimental package, some might gain their
own repo, most won't.

---

Most of the content of the repo are independent little scripts that can
be used either from the cli or the stream API.

---

experimental stuff goes in `experiments/**`. Usually
`experiments/**/readme.md` files includes more info.

---

`tools/**` includes a small collection of little node based cli tool.

```sh
cd tools/<whatev>
npm link
```
